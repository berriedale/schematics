= Schematics

Schematics are definitions for Ada dependencies, these are meant to be
processed by the Analytical Engine (`ae`) to bring dependencies in for Ada
projects.


== Envirnoment Variables

When performing source builds of schematics, the following environment
variables must be defined:


SCHEMATIC_INSTALL_PREFIX:: Absolute path to where schematics should be
installed.
SCHEMATIC_PARALLELISM:: Number of cores or desired parallelism to execute
various tasks with. More often than not this should be analogous to the `-j`
argument passed to `make(1)`.
